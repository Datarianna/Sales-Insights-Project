# Data Cleaning
### üí≤ Cleaning Transaction Sales Dataset

```python
print('- - - - - Transaction Sales - - - - -')
print('\nOriginal Dataset:')
ts = pd.read_csv('transaction_sales.csv')
print(ts.head())
```
| product_code | customer_code | market_code | order_date | sales_qty | sales_amount | currency |
|--------------|---------------|-------------|------------|-----------|--------------|----------|
|    Prod001   |    Cus001     |	 Mark001   | 2017-10-10 |	   100    |     41241    |	  INR   |
|    Prod001   |    Cus002     |	 Mark002   | 2018-05-08 |	   3      |      -1      |	  INR   |
|    Prod002   |    Cus003     |	 Mark003   | 2018-04-06 |	   1      |      875     |	  INR   |
|    Prod002   |    Cus003     |	 Mark003   | 2018-04-11 |	   1      |      583     |	  INR   |
|    Prod002   |    Cus004     |	 Mark003   | 2018-06-18 |	   6      |      7176    |	  INR   |


1. I first utilized .dropna() to remove any rows that contained null values. Examining the dataset
2. I have identified some rows that had a -1 and 0 under the ‚Äòsales_amount‚Äô column, so I removed those rows from the dataset.
3. Examining the data, there are only two currencies presented in the ‚Äòcurrency‚Äô column: INR and USD. Many of the rows in this column had an ‚Äò\r‚Äô at the end (ex. INR\r instead of INR), so they were removed.
4. Since some transactions were in USD, I created a new column called ‚Äònorm_sales_amount‚Äô which converts any sales amount in USD to INR.
5. Converted all values under the order_date into a date format.
6. Checked the dataset for anymore missing values before putting the new cleaned dataset into a new .csv file.
```python
ts = ts.dropna()
ts = ts.drop(ts[(ts['sales_amount']==-1) | (ts['sales_amount']==0)].index)
ts = ts.replace('INR\r','INR').replace('USD\r','USD')
ts['norm_sales_amount'] = ts['sales_amount']
ts.loc[ts['currency'] == 'USD','norm_sales_amount'] = ts.loc[ts['currency'] == 'USD','sales_amount']*82
ts['order_date'] = pd.to_datetime(ts['order_date'], dayfirst=False)

print('')
duplicate(ts)
missing(ts)

print('\nCleaned Dataset:')
print(ts.head())
ts.to_csv('clean_transaction_sales.csv', index=False)
```

### üåç Cleaning Markets Dataset
```python
print('\n- - - - - Market - - - - -')
print('\nOriginal Dataset:')
m = pd.read_csv('markets.csv')
print('Top 5 rows')
print(m.head())
print('Bottom 5 rows')
print(m.tail())
```

Top 5 rows
| markets_code | markets_name | zone |
|--------------|--------------|------|
|Mark001 |	Chennai |	South |
Mark002	| Mumbai |	Central |
Mark003	| Ahmedabad |	North |
Mark004	| Delhi NCR |	North |

| Mark014	| Hyderabad	| South |
| Mark015 |	Bhubaneshwar | South |
| Mark097 | New York | NaN |	
| Mark999 |	Paris	| NaN |


1. All rows with NA values were dropped, which happened to be the New York and Paris markets.
2. The column name ‚Äòmarkets_code‚Äô was changed to ‚Äòmarket_code‚Äô for consistency.
3. Used duplicated() to check for any row that is a duplicated. No duplicate rows were detected.
4. Checked the dataset for anymore missing values before putting the new cleaned dataset into a new .csv file.
```python
m = m.dropna()
m = m.rename(columns={'markets_code':'market_code'})

print('')
duplicate(m)
missing(m)

print('\nCleaned Dataset:')
print('Top 5 rows')
print(m.head())
print('Bottom 5 rows')
print(m.tail())
m.to_csv('clean_markets.csv', index=False)
```

### üßë Cleaning Customers Dataset
```python
print('\n- - - - - Customers - - - - -')
print('\nOriginal Dataset:')
c = pd.read_csv('customers.csv')
print(c.head())
```
|customer_code|custmer_name|customer_type|
|-------------|------------|-------------|
|Cus001|	Surge Stores|	Brick & Mortar|
|Cus002	|Nomad Stores	|Brick & Mortar|
|Cus003	|Excel Stores	|Brick & Mortar|
|Cus004	|Surface Stores|	Brick & Mortar|
|Cus005	|Premium Stores	|Brick & Mortar|


1. I fixed the misspelling of the ‚Äòcustmer_name‚Äô column.
2. Dropped any NA values from the dataset.
3. Checked for any duplicates in the dataset and none were detected.
4. I checked dataset for anymore missing values before putting the new cleaned dataset into a new .csv file.
```python
c = c.rename(columns={'custmer_name':'customer_name'})
c = c.dropna()
print('')
duplicate(c)
missing(c)

print('\nCleaned Dataset:')
print(c.head())
c.to_csv('clean_customers.csv', index=False)
```
|customer_code|customer_name|customer_type|
|-------------|------------|-------------|
|Cus001|	Surge Stores|	Brick & Mortar|
|Cus002	|Nomad Stores	|Brick & Mortar|
|Cus003	|Excel Stores	|Brick & Mortar|
|Cus004	|Surface Stores|	Brick & Mortar|
|Cus005	|Premium Stores	|Brick & Mortar|


### üñ±Ô∏è Cleaning Products Dataset
```python
print('\n- - - - - Products - - - - -')
print('Original Dataset:')
p = pd.read_csv('products.csv')
print(p.head())
```
|product_code |product_type|
|-------------|------------|
|Prod001 | Own Brand\r |
|   Prod002 | Own Brand\r|
|  Prod003  |Own Brand\r|
|  Prod004  |Own Brand\r|
|  Prod005  |Own Brand\r|
1. In this dataset, there is formatting issues under the ‚Äòproduct_type‚Äô column due to extra spacing, similarly to the currencies in the Transaction Sales dataset. I removed ‚Äò\r‚Äô from all rows.
2. Checked for duplicate rows, to which there were none.
3. I checked dataset for anymore missing values before putting the new cleaned dataset into a new .csv file.
```python
p['product_type'] = p['product_type'].str.rstrip("\r")
p = p.dropna()
print('')
duplicate(p)
missing(p)

print('\nCleaned Dataset:')
print(p.head())
p.to_csv('clean_products.csv', index=False)
```
|product_code |product_type|
|-------------|------------|
|Prod001 | Own Brand |
|   Prod002 | Own Brand|
|  Prod003  |Own Brand|
|  Prod004  |Own Brand|
|  Prod005  |Own Brand|

### üóìÔ∏è Cleaning Sales Years Dataset
```python
print('\n- - - - - Sales Years - - - - -')
sy = pd.read_csv('sales_years.csv')
print('Original Dataset:')
print(sy.head())
```
|date|cy_date|year|month_name|date_yy_mmm|
|-------------|------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
|2017-06-01|  2017-06-01 | 2017 |      June  |  17-Jun\r|
|2017-06-02 | 2017-06-01  |2017  |     June   | 17-Jun\r|
|  2017-06-03|  2017-06-01 | 2017 |      June  |  17-Jun\r|
|  2017-06-04 | 2017-06-01 | 2017  |     June  |  17-Jun\r|
|  2017-06-05 | 2017-06-01 | 2017   |    June  |  17-Jun\r|
1. Dropped the ‚Äòdate_yy_mmm‚Äô and ‚Äòcy_date‚Äô column since I felt that they were redundant.
2. Renamed the 'date' column to 'order_date' to make joins easier, as well as converted the ‚Äòorder_date‚Äô column into date format to ensure proper formatting.
4. Dropped the ‚Äòyear‚Äô and ‚Äòmonth_name‚Äô columns from the dataset and created new versions of them. This time, I extracted the year portion of the ‚Äòdate‚Äô column and put it into a new ‚Äòyear‚Äô column. Then, I extracted the month portion from the ‚Äòorder_date‚Äô column and put it into a new ‚Äòmonth_name‚Äô column while also making sure that it is written in the month name and not the month number. I did this to really make sure that they are in date format.
5. Checked for duplicate rows, to which there were none.
6. I checked dataset for anymore missing values before putting the new cleaned dataset into a new .csv file.
```python
sy.drop("date_yy_mmm", axis=1, inplace=True)
sy.drop("cy_date", axis=1, inplace=True)
sy = sy.rename(columns={'date':'order_date'})
sy['order_date'] = pd.to_datetime(sy['order_date'], dayfirst=False)
sy['year'] = sy['order_date'].dt.year
sy['month_name'] = sy['order_date'].dt.month_name()
print('')
duplicate(sy)
missing(sy)

print('\nCleaned Dataset:')
print(sy.head())
sy.to_csv('clean_sales_years.csv', index=False)
```

# Querying Results and Analysis
### Question 1: Who are the top five customers for AtliQ in 2019 based on total sales revenue?
I first created a left join between the Transaction Sales (left) and Customer (right) Datasets.
```python
join_ts_c = pd.merge(ts, c, on='customer_code', how='left')
print(join_ts_c.head())
```
|product_code |customer_code| market_code| order_date|  sales_qty | sales_amount |currency|norm_sales_amount|customer_name|customer_type|
|-------------|-------------|------------|-----------|------------|--------------|--------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|
| Prod001     | Cus001      |Mark001     | 2017-10-10|     100    |     41241   |   INR      |        41241  |  Surge Stores | Brick & Mortar
|   Prod002   |    Cus003   |Mark003     | 2018-04-06 |    1      |   875     | INR        |        875  |  Excel Stores | Brick & Mortar
|  Prod002    |   Cus003    |Mark003     | 2018-04-11 |      1    |   583    |  INR        |        583  |  Excel Stores | Brick & Mortar
|   Prod002   |   Cus004    |Mark003     | 2018-06-18|     6      | 7176   |   INR        |       7176 | Surface Stores | Brick & Mortar
|  Prod003    |  Cus005     |Mark004     |2017-11-20  |   59      | 500    |  USD          |    41000 | Premium Stores | Brick & Mortar

1. Created a filter that will only contain rows with an order date within the year 2019.
2. Grouped the filtered dataset by customers and summed up the total normalized sales amount for each customer.
3. Sorted the dataframe in descending order and ensured to only include the top five customers and their total sales.
```python
year_filter = join_ts_c[(join_ts_c['order_date']>='2019-01-01') & (join_ts_c['order_date']<='2019-12-31')]
top_five_customers = year_filter.groupby('customer_name')['norm_sales_amount'].sum().sort_values(ascending=False).head(5)
print(top_five_customers)
```
|customer_name         | |
|----------------------|-|
|Electricalsara Stores |917920
|Electricalslytical    |629237
|Logic Stores          |525379
|Path                  |454822
|Info Stores           |347682
Name: norm_sales_amount, dtype: int64
**Answer**: According to the dataframe, the customer that has spent the most money on AtliQ Hardware is Electricalsara Stores, with a sales amount of ‚Çπ917920. The second 

### Question 2: What is the trend of total sales revenue for AtliQ in 2017-2019?
1. Created a filter that filters in rows that are within the years 2017-2019.
2. Grouped the filtered dataset by the order date year, then summed up the total normalized sales amount for each year.
```python
year_filter = ts[(ts['order_date']>='2017-01-01') & (ts['order_date']<='2019-12-31')]
total_rev_years = year_filter.groupby(year_filter['order_date'].dt.year)['norm_sales_amount'].sum()
print(total_rev_years)
```
|order_date| |
|----------|-|
|2017  |  1895109
|2018  |  7687469
|2019  |  3296370
Name: norm_sales_amount, dtype: int64

### Question 3: Within the last year, which top three products sold the most in terms of the quantity of sales?
```python

```
